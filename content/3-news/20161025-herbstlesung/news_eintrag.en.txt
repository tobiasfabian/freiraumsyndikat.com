This autumn Freiraum Syndikat is experiencing an intensive phase with four musical readings and the revival of the successful play „Sommernacht im Wintergarten“. 
While enjoying the wonderful actors reading the strong texts by Eric Emmanuel Schmitt we find new sounds, counterpoints and new ways to express emotions in our music. 
An exciting playground for inspiration and discoveries!
