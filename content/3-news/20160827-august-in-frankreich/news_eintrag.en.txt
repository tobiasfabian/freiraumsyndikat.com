Title: Summer Gleanings And Autumn Preview

----

Text: 

Our first (small) international concert tour to Normandy, France is over now. We played three concerts at "Festival Moments Musicaux" and presented our new program to the audience.
It has been a wonderful time for us and we are happy to announce that we will come back next year!
Autumn this year means touring Thüringen (a region in the east of Germany) for us. We are looking forward to the resumption of the play "Sommernacht im Wintergarten" in cooperation with the Figure Theatre Gera and the start of the series „Cycle Of The Invisible - musical readings on the four world religions“ in cooperation with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the wonderful actors of the Theatre and Philharmonic Orchestra Thüringen. This project gives us the chance to explore the magical meeting of music and spoken word.
