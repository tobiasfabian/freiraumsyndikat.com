In August, Freiraum Syndikat will introduce their new program to the international audience of Germany and France.
The Ensemble is working on their new pieces, which are now in context of new themes after experience with the successful program of „Sommernacht im Wintergarten“.  At the same time, Elisabeth Neuser’s Paetzold recorder is integrated and makes additional registers and areas of sound possible.

**Strange Meeting** introduces a song by Bill Frisell, who is well known for the idea of diversity and freedom in style, as the guiding theme and becomes the musical foundation of encounters and entertainment for Freiraum Syndikat as well.

The sustaining element of this ensemble, which works in multiple styles, and it’s founding inspiration is the examination of the unfamiliar and meeting of different worlds.

As before, this program naturally bridges adaptations of music from Johan-Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazolla, Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell, and Radiohead all the way to ABBA or Michael Jackson. In the process, the improvisation connects opportunities for new music as an open playing field.

Original compositions complement the colorful program of these four international soloists in unusual formation.  At the same time, the many possibilities to combine instrumentation and musical styles become the concept of a classical band. 

The musicians are familiar with openly meeting and communicating with the audience.
