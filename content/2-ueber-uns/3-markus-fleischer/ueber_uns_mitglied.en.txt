Intro: 

As an improvising jazz musician, I Iook for the magic of instinctive interaction in all musical encounters. Freiraum Syndikat offers an extremely attractive playing field far from the usual improvisation mainstream. Since I play the only instrument with chords, I have the task to give the sound of the band a harmonious consistency and to use the range of the guitar to set the stage for the cello and the recorders.

I am guided by the old jazz motto “It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing!” I would translate this for our purposes as “music must dance”.
