Intro: 

The low tones of the recorder especially appeal to me. I prefer all the larger instruments of the recorder family, and the lower the sounds the more I am at ease. 

Therefore, in Freiraum Syndikat, I am most often given the role of creating a link between the homogenous sound of the two recorders and the cello and the guitar.

**Elisabeth Neuser** is a student of Myriam Eichberger at the University of Music Franz Liszt in Early Music.

Elisabeth also with conductors Helmut Rilling and Māris Kupčs.

Elisabeth’s studies also emphasize music of the European Renaissance. Thus, she founded the Ensembles  (link: http://www.paradizo-consort.de text: Paradizo popup: true) and is a permanent member of the (link: http://www.silviamuller.com/de/ensemble/lachrimae-consort-weimar text: Lachrimae Consort Weimar popup: true)

Her project “An Innovative Recorder School” is supported by “Thuringia Graduate Development Scholarships”, and as small musical ensemble together with Friederike Vollert, she received a scholarship from the Yehudi Menuhin Live Music Now Organisation.
