**The ensemble was founded in 2015 based on the idea of creating create something new by combining different musical traditions and inspirations. There is already a demand internationally because of its open and unique combination of instruments and specialists.**

With this project, Lukas Dreyer, the founder, has created free space for new musical encounters, which ranges from arrangement to improvisation all the way to the possibility of discovering entirely new genres.

In close collaboration with the jazz musician Markus Fleischer and the two baroque musicians Elisabeth Neuser and Friederike Vollert musical concepts are being developed, which are shaping the young ensemble from the beginning, also in cooperation with the puppet theater of the Gera Theater and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.

During a concert the audience will experience four likable people, who have been brought together by their passion for discovering new worlds of sound together.

Their talent and experience form the framework for working with music spanning over 500 years. Out of it a musical fusion comes into being, and the creative process between chamber music and band comes alive.
