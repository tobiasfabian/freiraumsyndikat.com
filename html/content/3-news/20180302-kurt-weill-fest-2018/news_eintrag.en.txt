LaBETTLEROPERa on tour! 
 
Our Premiere on Kurt Weill Fest in Dessau last sunday was a very successful project. The audience loved the show. The applause was frenetic. More than 850 people attended an inspring evening in perfect musical harmony as a highligt for the festival presented by the project Freiraum Syndikat on stage together with Balletto Civile in the production of Neuk√∂llner Oper. 

The international known composer Moritz Eggert wrote over 40 peaces - beautiful songs and dances for this new version of the beggar's opera.  The idea of recomposing this plot is leaded by a multi-stilistic in musical, artistic and dramatic art.
 
It's one of the special moments where the audience is going to be divided into people who like to be surprised and people who try to compare to famous versions like Dreigroschen Oper by Kurt Weill. 
The brave artists on stage won! Thanks to all contributors for this adventure.

It's the beginning of a new story for Freiraum Syndikat. We love to run this new possibilities!
